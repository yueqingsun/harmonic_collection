            <ol>
                <li>Don't search this perfume online. Go to the store.</li>

                <li>The real DReAm perfume can be smelled from three meters away. If you can only smell it within a metre, keep away from the perfume</li>
                <li>There is a moving carriage wagon on the perfume bottle, and there are two people in each wagon. Don't stop them.</li>
                <li>When you pay for it, remember to lick it.</li>
                <li>Only the staff who in red is responsible to packaging. If it's someone in blue packing for you, get out of here as fast as you can.</li>

            <h2>After You Buy</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Within two hours of the perfume entering your home, stop the carriage wagon and the people.</li>
                <li>If it rains heavily at 9.58 p.m., be sure to spray 4 doses of drEaM perfume in the room.</li>

                <li>Don't wear drEaM perfume when you go to Flushing. You won't see who you want to see.</li>
                <li>If you laugh five times in one day, the perfume will become sad five months later.</li>
                <li>Keep aware of the perfume when the perfume is awake.</li>
                <li>Don't trust what does the perfume say, but when the perfume starts singing, please slow down and listen carefully.</li>
                <li>If you encounter someone use the same drEaM perfume, remember not to talk too loud.</li>
